            Memorization Station is a application designed to help people learn more about memory systems,
            and to serve as a tool to aid users in building memorization systems of their own.

            A basic concept of most memory systems is that by creating a scaffolding of known objects/places/things that can be associated 
            with new information 
            
            d to provide tools for building your own charts
            and lists of associations to use when building out your own memory systems.
