            Memorization Station is a web application designed to help people to learn more about memory systems,
            and to serve as a tool to aid users in building memorization systems of their own.

          <p>
            A basic concept underlying most memorization systems is this: by creating a scaffolding of known objects/places/things that can be associated 
            with new information to be memorized, we are able to create visual associations, journeys, or stories in our imagination that increases one's ability to recall
            memorized information.  This allows the brain to utilize the visual cortex's innate ability to create vivid memories with visual information.

            Memorization Station allows users to build charts which are made up of memory objects.  These charts are meant to represent memory palaces, journeys, etc.,
            and the memory objects they are made up of are meant to serve as 'nodes' where information to be memorized can be stored and more easily recalled.  This
            can be very useful in increasing one's ability to learn and easily remember information about many different topics.
