          <p>The human mind is an amazing thing.  In fact, it is the most complex object in the universe that we are 
          currently aware of, and yet we still are only just breaking the surface in terms of understanding the mechanisms behind how it actually works.</p>

          <p>One of the most amazing things about the brain is its ability to store and retrieve vast amounts of information.  One of the key insights
          that was understood by those who first began using memory systems was that the more senses we use when storing a piece of information, the more likely 
          we are to be able to recall that information quickly.  This is seen most prominently with our sense of sight.</p>

          <p>Studies have shown that when the visual cortex is engaged when creating a memory, it makes the memory much more readily available for recall.  
          For example, if I ask you what you ate for breakfast last week on Wednesday, you may be unlikely to remember what you ate that morning.  
          But if, on that day, you had been eating your Corn Pops on the top of the Empire State building while King Kong fought with helicopters all around you, 
          the memory would likely stand out as much more vivid and you'd probably remember many small details about the experience, including that you were eating Corn Pops,
          and that the milk kept spilling everywhere due to all the commotion!</p>

          <p>As it turns out, it makes little difference that you didn't actually have that experience.
          The imagination is so powerful that, if you intended to remember what you were having for breakfast that day, and made a decision to imagine yourself 
          in that outlandish situation as you had your cereal, you would be unlikely to forget it any time soon.  You might recall what you had had that day years later.</p>
          
          <p>Most memory systems involve using these insights about the mind to build a "scaffolding" of sorts - a group known objects or locations
          with which to associate information to be memorized.  These are sometimes known as memory maps, journeys, palaces, etc.  </p>

          <p>Each of these is basically a sort of collection of these memory objects, visualized to be arranged in a certain order or position 
          (items in specific places in a memory palace, or stops along a familiar journey, etc.).</p>

          <p>In this way, once a journey or palace is built and cemented in place in the memorizers mind so
          they can easily be recalled at will, each object or location can then act like nodes that 
          a memorizer can then use to store new information by creating vivid associations in their mind between the node
          and the information they plan to recall.</p>
